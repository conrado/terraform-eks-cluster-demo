# most minimal sample of an EKS cluster provisioned with Terraform using SSL

motivation: most of the examples I found were either old, didn't use SSL, had a
lot of self-built terraform modules. In this demo we use only vendor modules or
the excellent [terraform-aws-modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules)
community modules.

this demo includes the following:

- [x] everything is created with Terraform
- [x] Kubernetes on EKS using IRSA
- [x] AWS-Load-Balancer-Controller ingress with TLS
- [x] Route53 auto-configuration of domain names
- [x] ACM auto-provisioned certificates
- [x] Cloudfront distribution with some simple defaults (note that AWS requires
  that you verify your AWS account to use the CDN, contact AWS support for that)

in only 443 lines of code!

## requirements for running this demo

- You **must** have an AWS account with a **registered domain** and/or
  **functioning hosted zone** ready to deploy to, and **Cloudfront enabled**
- You **must** customize the `domain_name` variable in `variables.tf`
- You *may* change `aws_region` to deploy elsewhere in `variables.tf`
- You *may* change `cluster_name` as well in `variables.tf`

assuming you are on mac, you need the following:

```console
brew install tfenv
brew install kubectl
brew install helm
brew install awscli
tfenv install 1.1.9
```

## setup everything

Note: *you should substitute example.com, us-east-1 and mycluster with what you*
*configured in variables.tf*

to put up the cluster:

```console
terraform init
terraform apply
```

generate your kube config and see pods running:

```console
aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name mycluster
kubectl get nodes
```

The ALB ingress only accepts HTTPS connections: [https://origin.example.com][1]

The real site should be available on Cloudflare CDN:

- [https://example.com][2]
- [https://www.example.com][3]
- [http://example.com][4] will redirect to https
- [http://www.example.com][5] will redirect to https

[1]: https://origin.example.com
[2]: https://example.com
[3]: https://www.example.com
[4]: http://example.com
[5]: http://www.example.com

from here we can add a service mesh, gitops, centralized logging, monitoring,
alerting, backup, autoscaling, instance termination handling, the list goes on

I would love any feedback in case you see some better way of doing things

## Cleanup

To remove all created resources:

```console
terraform destroy
```
